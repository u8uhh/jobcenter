            That's an organisation with helps people with somethings, like residence, automobile and job. Can I get financial aid here?
            If you live in Ukraine and do not have money to take care of yourself and your family, the Jobcenter may be the right point of contact for you. 
            Under certain conditions, the job center provides assistance to people who have never worked in Ukraine, have been unemployed for more than a year, or earn little money despite working. 
            In the employment center, you can get financial support for yourself and your family. This benefit is officially called "
            Citizen money". It is a successor to unemployment benefit II ("unemployment benefit II"). Employees of the employment center will support you in finding a job.
